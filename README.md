[![VIdeo demonstrativo](https://i.ibb.co/Tch19KV/carupi.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJwwuFZGKFg")

   This system was created for carupi's technical test, I developed a system with 2 pages, home and internal, where in a fictitious scenario joão can see the most popular games in the Rawg API, in addition to being able to see details about these games, but I put a back-end, together with a CRUD, so that the project can later have a more professional side, like a specific system for games.

## :dart: Goal

  The objective of this project is to make a fictitious environment where João needs a game site with two pages (home and internal).

Home: Page with a list of the most popular games.

Internal: Clicking on a game will show game name, photo, categories, platforms and developer
about the game.

## :desktop_computer: What i solved?

   The idea of the project was initially to consume the Rawg API and show game information via API, through Axios, but I developed, in addition to the exercise request, a database in the Back-end, together with a CRUD and a route system, which can be adapted to an environment where later you can create a login system with games that the user likes the most, and add, delete, list and manipulate any data from that user within the dashboard, in the home part, the user can hover over the game image and by an animation you will be shown information about the game.
	I used Bootstrap to facilitate some styles of the site, but also produces a part of the CSS by hand, with the responsibility of the site, Axios was used both in the Back and Front-end, created the site through React, using create -react-app, and I took advantage and used some React Hooks to enrich and facilitate some parts of the project.
